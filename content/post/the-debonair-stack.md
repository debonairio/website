"A debonair must know the entire stack." - wise man.

A software stack is quite an abstract thought. You can think of it as a set of programs that work together to produce an end result.

For example, the end result of this, is a website. Whatever components are needed for this website to run are what make up its stack.

In this case, the stack consists of Ghost, node.js, and docker.

More soon to come.
